## Disease - Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is a progressive genetic disorder that primarily impacts the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. In individuals with CF, mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene result in a malfunctioning CFTR protein. This defective protein is unable to properly transport chloride, a component of salt, to the cell surface. Without chloride, water cannot be drawn to the cell surface, causing mucus in various organs to become thick and sticky.

In the lungs, this thick mucus obstructs the airways and traps germs such as bacteria, leading to infections, inflammation, respiratory failure, and other complications. Consequently, minimizing exposure to germs is a critical priority for individuals with CF.

## Hypothesis
The disruption of the CFTR protein-protein interaction network alters the regulatory landscape of gene expression, leading to a cascade of molecular events that result in non-wild-type CFTR expression and function, ultimately contributing to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.

## Report
We identified Cystic Fibrosis as our disease of interest and CFTR as the gene associated with this phenotype. We then built a PPI network using the expression of the gene as seeds, and found tissue-specific eQTLs DNA polymorphisms that may be the responsible. These findings contributed to our hypothesis formation, which was then compiled into this repository. No code was needed to complete this.
