## Hypothesis
The disruption of the CFTR protein-protein interaction network alters the regulatory landscape of gene expression, leading to a cascade of molecular events that result in non-wild-type CFTR expression and function, ultimately contributing to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.

## Report
We identified Cystic Fibrosis as our disease of interest and CFTR as the gene associated with this phenotype. We then built a PPI network using the expression of the gene as seeds, and found tissue-specific eQTLs DNA polymorphisms that may be the responsible. These findings contributed to our hypothesis formation, which was then compiled into this repository. No code was needed to complete this.
